# ModelPicker

Apollo's shared LLM model picker, built on the UiPath LLM Gateway Discovery API. Ships in `@uipath/apollo-wind`.

This is a port of apollo-react's Material `ap-model-picker` onto wind primitives (Radix + Tailwind), for hosts that cannot take a MUI dependency. The headless layer — `types.ts`, `utils.ts`, `badges.ts`, `useModelPickerState.ts`, `useDiscoveryModels.ts`, `usePlatformAccess.ts` — is a near-verbatim copy of the apollo-react source, and the two components share a prop surface, so behaviour stays in lockstep. The differences are listed under [Differences from the apollo-react picker](#differences-from-the-apollo-react-picker).

It renders a labeled trigger that opens a popup with a built-in folder switcher, a search field, a Category ⇆ Provider grouping pill, grouped sections — Custom Models (BYO) always first — and a "Use custom model" footer for users who can manage BYO.

The picker owns its data: given a `requestContext` it fetches the Discovery catalog, the folder list, BYO connection names, and the org-admin check itself. Your code owns only the `value`. (Every fetch can be overridden by the matching prop — `models`, `folders`, `canManageByo` — for hosts with their own data layer.)

---

## Quick start

```tsx
import { ModelPicker } from '@uipath/apollo-wind';

const requestContext = React.useMemo(() => ({
  token: () => getAccessToken(),    // getter → never goes stale
  baseUrl,                          // 'https://cloud.uipath.com/acme'
  tenantName,
  tenantId,                         // tenant GUID (admin-page deep links)
  userId,                           // token's `sub` claim (Discovery user scoping)
  requestingProduct: 'agents',
  requestingFeature: 'design-eval-deploy',
}), [baseUrl, tenantName, tenantId, userId]);

const [value, setValue] = React.useState<string | null>(null);

<ModelPicker
  value={value}
  onChange={(model) => setValue(model.modelId)}
  requestContext={requestContext}
  enableFolders
/>
```

That's the whole integration: the picker fetches Discovery (`{baseUrl}/{tenantName}/llmgateway_/api/discovery`), refetches when the user switches folders, resolves BYO connection names, gates the BYO affordances on the org-admin check, and renders its own loading/error states. The rest of this document covers the per-product customization surface.

---

## Per-product customization

The picker is one shared visual + behavioral contract. Everything below is a prop on `<ModelPicker>` — no forks, no wrappers, no design-system PRs.

### 1. Filter the visible catalog

When your product should only show a subset of what Discovery returns (specific modalities, operation codes, current-user permissions, region constraints), pass a `filter`:

```tsx
<ModelPicker
  models={models}
  filter={(m) =>
    m.byomDetails?.availableOperationCodes?.includes('agents-design-eval-deploy') ??
    m.modelSubscriptionType === 'UiPathOwned'
  }
  value={value}
  onChange={(m) => setValue(m.modelId)}
/>
```

**Notes:**

- `filter` runs **before** grouping and search. Empty groups disappear cleanly.
- A `value` whose id is filtered out still resolves — the trigger renders normally, no spurious "unknown model" error.
- Pass a **stable function reference** if `models` is large; the hook re-derives groups whenever `filter` changes identity.

**Modality is a product decision.** The picker renders whatever Discovery serves — it does not assume text generation. Products that only offer chat models opt in with the exported helper, which drops embeddings (by `apiFlavor`) and realtime (by `modelType`):

```tsx
import { isTextGenerationModel } from '@uipath/apollo-wind';

<ModelPicker filter={isTextGenerationModel} … />
```

An indexing or context-grounding surface picks embeddings from the same catalog, so excluding them centrally would break it. The one thing the picker *does* drop unconditionally is `isBlockedByPolicy` — that's an org-wide governance verdict, not a product preference.

### 2. Friendly names

Display names travel on the Discovery DTO, like Recommended. Product teams author them centrally in their Model Hub configuration; the gateway merges them into the response as `displayName`, so every row shows the human label ("Claude Sonnet 4.6") over a monospace technical id, and the trigger matches — with no wiring:

```tsx
// The picker renders `model.displayName` when the DTO carries it.
<ModelPicker models={models} value={value} onChange={(m) => setValue(m.modelId)} />
```

**Products cannot rename models.** There is deliberately no name prop: the same model reads identically in every product surface, and a wrong or missing name is fixed once, centrally, not patched per product. Models without an authored name fall back to the raw `modelName`. Search matches display names as well as technical ids.

**BYO connection names.** BYO rows render a disambiguating caption from `byoConnectionLabel`. When the DTO doesn't carry one (Discovery serves only `byomDetails.integrationServiceConnectionId`), the picker resolves the connection's display name itself via `GET {baseUrl}/{tenantName}/connections_/api/v1/Connections/{id}` — one request per distinct connection, cached for the component's lifetime; a host-supplied `byoConnectionLabel` always wins and suppresses the lookup. If the user cannot read a connection, its row simply renders without a caption.

### 3. Badges from the Apollo pool

The picker derives lifecycle chips automatically (Recommended, Preview, Deprecating, Substituted, Custom, Out-of-region). For product badges beyond those, Apollo owns a shared **badge pool** (`MODEL_BADGES` in `badges.ts`): each pool entry defines the badge's label, tooltip, color variant, and localization once, so the same badge reads identically in every product. Products stamp pool badges per model with `badgesFor`:

```tsx
<ModelPicker
  models={models}
  badgesFor={(m) => (isExpensive(m) ? ['cost-premium'] : ['cost-basic'])}
  value={value}
  onChange={(m) => setValue(m.modelId)}
/>
```

The pool currently ships the cost tiers: `cost-basic`, `cost-standard`, `cost-premium`. **Adding a badge to the pool is a design-system PR**: one entry in `badges.ts` plus its descriptor in `i18n.ts` — not a per-product invention. That keeps naming, colors, and translations consistent everywhere.

**Defining a new pool badge** (using a hypothetical "Early access" badge as the example):

1. **Declare the label in `i18n.ts`** — add descriptors to `BADGE_LABELS`, keyed under the `modelPicker.badge.*` id namespace:

   ```ts
   export const BADGE_LABELS = {
     // …existing cost-tier labels…
     earlyAccess: msg({
       id: 'modelPicker.badge.earlyAccess.label',
       message: 'Early access',
     }),
     earlyAccessTooltip: msg({
       id: 'modelPicker.badge.earlyAccess.tooltip',
       message: 'Available before general rollout',
     }),
   } as const;
   ```

2. **Register the kind in `badges.ts`** — extend the `ModelBadgeKind` union and add the matching `MODEL_BADGES` entry:

   ```ts
   export type ModelBadgeKind =
     | 'cost-basic'
     | 'cost-standard'
     | 'cost-premium'
     | 'early-access';

   export const MODEL_BADGES: Record<ModelBadgeKind, ModelBadgeDefinition> = {
     // …existing cost tiers…
     'early-access': {
       label: BADGE_LABELS.earlyAccess,
       tooltip: BADGE_LABELS.earlyAccessTooltip, // tooltip is optional
       variant: 'info-mini',
     },
   };
   ```

3. **Tell hosts about the key** — apollo-wind ships no catalogs, so a localized host adds `modelPicker.badge.earlyAccess.label` to its own. Hosts that don't translate get the English `message` automatically.

That's the whole surface: because `ModelBadgeKind` is a union, every product's `badgesFor` callback can return `'early-access'` immediately, and TypeScript flags typos at compile time.

**Picking a `variant`:** default to neutral gray `mini` unless the semantic color genuinely applies (`info-mini`, `success-mini`, `warning-mini`, `error-mini`); `ModelTagChip` maps each onto a wind `Badge` variant. The cost tiers deliberately stay neutral — warning/error coloring would read as "this model is risky", which a price tier is not.

Pool badges render after the built-in chips so the picker's canonical signals (Recommended / Preview / lifecycle) always read first.

**Escape hatch:** `customTagsFor` still accepts free-form `ModelTag`s (appended after pool badges) for experiments and one-offs pending a pool addition; color new kinds via `customTagVariants` (`mini`, `info-mini`, `success-mini`, `warning-mini`, `error-mini`; unknown kinds fall back to neutral gray `mini`). Anything worth shipping should graduate into the pool.

### 4. Recommended and Preview

Recommended and Preview travel on the Discovery DTO. Product teams author their Recommended list in their product's Model Hub configuration; the gateway merges it into the Discovery response, so every model arrives with `isRecommended` and `isPreview` set. The picker builds the corresponding groups and chips from those fields:

```tsx
// The Recommended group + chip come from `model.isRecommended`,
// Preview from `model.isPreview` — no wiring needed.
<ModelPicker models={models} value={value} onChange={(m) => setValue(m.modelId)} />
```

To promote or retire a model, edit your product's Model Hub configuration — no frontend change needed.

Resolution order: `recommendedModelIds` prop (test/storybook override) → DTO `isRecommended` → a local heuristic (`UiPathOwned && !preview && !deprecating`) for backends that don't send the field yet.

### 5. Cost badges

Cost badges are **on by default**: whenever the Discovery DTO carries cost data, each row gets its tier from the Apollo pool (`cost-basic` / `cost-standard` / `cost-premium`) via `defaultCostTier`, which bins `modelDetails.costDetails.flatCosts.inputTokenCost` (cents per million input tokens, the gateway's unit; the first tier is used for tiered pricing) at `$1`/M and `$5`/M. No wiring needed.

A host-supplied `badgesFor` takes over entirely — return your own pool kinds to reclassify, or `[]` to suppress badges:

```tsx
<ModelPicker badgesFor={(m) => (isExpensive(m) ? ['cost-premium'] : [])} … />
```

### 6. BYO management

BYO management affordances — the edit row action and the "Use custom model" footer — appear only for **organization administrators**, the same gate the Automation Cloud portal puts on the AI Trust Layer admin pages these affordances navigate to. Pass a `requestContext` and the picker runs the check:

```tsx
const requestContext = React.useMemo(() => ({
  token,
  baseUrl,                          // origin + org prefix, e.g. 'https://cloud.uipath.com/acme'
  tenantName,                       // path segment for platform routes
  tenantId,                         // tenant GUID (admin-page deep links)
  requestingProduct: 'agents',      // pre-populates the add-configuration form
  requestingFeature: 'design-eval-deploy',
}), [token, baseUrl, tenantName, tenantId]);

<ModelPicker models={models} requestContext={requestContext} />
```

Under the hood: `GET {baseUrl}/portal_/api/organization/UserOrganizationInfo` — org admin means `accountRoleType` is `ACCOUNT_ADMIN` or `ACCOUNT_OWNER` (the portal's own `isOrgAdminSelector` rule). The check **fails closed**: affordances stay hidden while loading, on error, and while re-checking after the context changes. It is a client-side affordance gate only; the configurations pages and APIs enforce authorization server-side.

**Default navigation.** With a `requestContext` in place the affordances work with zero extra wiring — both lead to the AI Trust Layer LLM-configurations surface (`{baseUrl}/portal_/admin/ai-trust-layer/llm-configurations`):

- The **"Use custom model" footer** opens the *add configuration* form, deep-linked to `/{tenantId}/{folderId}/add` and pre-populated via `?product=&feature=` from `requestingProduct`/`requestingFeature`. The folder id is the switcher's current selection, or — when none is selected ("All folders") — the first available folder, matching the configurations page's own default. Only when no folders exist does it fall back to the configurations list.
- The **edit row action** (BYO rows only) opens the configuration's *edit* form when the model carries `byomDetails.byoConfigurationId` (served by Discovery on UiPath/Arima#2659); when absent it lands on the configurations list scoped to the tenant + folder.
- The **delete row action** (BYO rows only) is owned by the picker in self-fetch mode. It renders a delete icon next to edit on BYO rows that carry a `byoConfigurationId`, confirms first (a built-in dialog naming the configuration), then issues the platform call itself:

  ```
  DELETE {gateway}/api/byo/product/llm-configurations/{byoConfigurationId}
  ```

  It reuses the credentials and org/tenant path it already holds for Discovery, refetches the catalog, and reports failures in its own error surface (the gateway's message, verbatim). Products do **not** implement this request.

  Pass `onModelDeleted` to react afterwards. Its one real job is reconciling state the picker cannot see — above all, choosing a replacement when the deleted model was the current selection. The picker deliberately does not choose one for you:

  ```tsx
  <ModelPicker
    requestContext={ctx}
    value={selected}
    onChange={setSelected}
    onModelDeleted={(model) => {
      if (model.modelName === selected) setSelected(nextDefault());
    }}
  />
  ```

  `onDeleteModel` remains as an opt-out for hosts that must route the call elsewhere — the picker then confirms, calls it, and refetches, but issues no request of its own. With a host-owned `models` list there is no request context to delete with, so `onDeleteModel` is the only way to surface a delete action at all.

These navigations always open the AI Trust Layer pages in a new browser tab - the picker is embedded in a product surface, and navigating it away would unload the user's in-progress work. `onUseCustomModel` overrides the footer's default navigation (e.g. an in-app wizard), and `slots.optionActions` overrides the row actions. Products with their own authorization model can pass `canManageByo` (`true`/`false`); when set, no admin check request is made.

### 7. Folder scoping

Set `enableFolders` and the picker fetches the current user's Orchestrator folders (via the same `requestContext`), renders the toolbar switcher, owns the selection, and refetches Discovery scoped to the picked folder (`X-UiPath-FolderKey`). Your product only decides whether folder scoping applies to its surface:

```tsx
<ModelPicker requestContext={requestContext} enableFolders />
```

Pass `folder` + `onFolderChange` to control the selection instead (e.g. when the host owns the catalog via `models` and refetches itself).

Under the hood: `GET {baseUrl}/{tenantName}/orchestrator_/api/FoldersNavigation/GetFoldersForCurrentUser` (the same call the Automation Cloud portal makes). Folder ids are Orchestrator folder **Keys** (GUIDs). Personal-workspace folders (`FolderType === 'Personal'`) are always excluded — a personal workspace is not a meaningful scope for shared model configurations; a host that really needs one can supply it via the `folders` prop.

The picker prepends an "All folders" sentinel automatically; picking it selects `null` — Discovery is refetched without a `folderKey`, returning the union of all folders the user can see.

For tests and Storybook, the `folders` prop overrides the internal fetch with a static list.

### 8. View toggle (Category ⇆ Provider)

Both views are built-in. Users switch via a pill segmented control on the toolbar. To control the initial view or hide the toggle entirely:

```tsx
<ModelPicker
  groupBy="vendor"               // initial view: by Provider
  allowGroupingChange={false}    // hide the Category|Provider pill
/>
```

In **Category** view, the section order is: Custom Models (BYO) → Recommended → Preview → More models → Deprecating soon → Other.

In **Provider** view, Custom Models (BYO) comes first, followed by one section per vendor (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Vertex, AWS Bedrock, …). Within each vendor section, models are ordered by lifecycle: Recommended → Preview → the rest → Deprecating last.

In both views the BYO section is the only collapsible one — it starts expanded, and the header chevron folds it.

### 9. Escape hatches (slots)

Slots are the "I need to do something the picker doesn't natively support" surface. Most products won't need them; reach for a slot only when no prop fits:

```tsx
<ModelPicker
  models={models}
  slots={{
    // Replace the default "Use custom model" footer.
    popupFooter: ({ close }) => (
      <MyCustomFooter onClick={() => { close(); openMyWizard(); }} />
    ),
    // Per-row right-aligned actions (overrides the default edit action).
    optionActions: (m) => (m.byoConnectionLabel ? <MyActions model={m} /> : null),
    // Per-row meta column (between chips and actions).
    optionMeta: (m) => <ContextWindowBar tokens={m.modelDetails?.contextWindowTokens} />,
    // Custom content inside the trigger, next to the model name.
    triggerExtra: (m) => m && <EffortChip />,
    // Banner above the toolbar (e.g. a tenant-level notice).
    popupHeader: () => <TenantUpgradeBanner />,
    // Inline content to the left of the search field (overrides built-in folder switcher).
    searchLeading: () => <MyCustomFolderPicker />,
    // Content directly below the option list, above any popupFooter.
    listFooter: ({ close }) => <ShowAllModelsToggle />,
  }}
/>
```

**Rule of thumb:** if you find yourself reaching for a slot for something everyone wants, propose a new prop instead.

| `enableFolders`       | `boolean`                                             | Turn on folder scoping — the picker fetches the user's Orchestrator folders via `requestContext`. Default `false`.   |
| `folders`             | `readonly { id; label }[]`                            | Test/storybook override for the folder list (skips the internal fetch).                                              |
| `folder`              | `string \| null`                                      | Selected folder id (Orchestrator folder Key), or `null` for "All folders".                                           |
| `onFolderChange`      | `(next: string \| null) => void`                      | Folder change callback. Re-fetch your catalog with the new `folderKey`.                                              |
| `allFoldersLabel`     | `string`                                              | Override the "All folders" sentinel label.                                                                           |
| `showGroupHeaders`    | `boolean`                                             | Default `true`. Set `false` for a flat list (grouping is still applied to ordering).                                 |
| `popupContainer`      | `Element \| DocumentFragment \| 'body' \| null`         | Portal target for the popup. Defaults to the nearest `PortalContainerProvider`, then `document.body`.                 |
| `translator`          | `PickerTranslator`                                    | Resolves the picker's own strings. Defaults to English source text. See [Internationalization](#internationalization). |
| `slots`               | `ModelPickerSlots`                                    | Escape hatches. See above.                                                                                           |

## Data flow

With only a `requestContext`, the picker fetches Discovery itself over the platform route (`{baseUrl}/{tenantName}/llmgateway_/api/discovery`, headers `X-UiPath-LlmGateway-RequestingProduct`/`-RequestingFeature`/`-UserId`, plus `X-UiPath-FolderKey` when a folder is selected) — exposed as `usePlatformDiscoveryModels` for hosts that want the same fetch outside the picker.

Pass `models` to take over: the built-in fetch turns off and the picker renders exactly what you give it (SWR, React Query, Redux, or `useDiscoveryModels` — the direct-gateway flavor with internal account/tenant headers).

---

## Accessibility

The picker implements the WAI-ARIA listbox pattern with keyboard input:

- **Trigger** is `aria-haspopup="listbox"`, with `aria-controls` pointing at the popup, `aria-expanded`, `aria-invalid`, `aria-required`, and `aria-describedby` linking to the error message.
- **Search input** is `aria-autocomplete="list"`, `aria-controls={listboxId}`, with `aria-activedescendant` updating to the highlighted option as the user navigates with `↑`/`↓` — DOM focus stays on the search.
- **Listbox** has an `aria-label` ("Models" by default, localized).
- **Each option** has a stable id (`{listboxId}-opt-{modelId}`), `role="option"`, and `aria-selected`.
- **Loading / error / empty / result-count** announce via `role="status"` + `aria-live="polite"` and `role="alert"` for errors.
- **Required asterisk** is `aria-hidden` (the input carries `aria-required`).

Keyboard:

- `↑` / `↓` — move the active row
- `Enter` — select the active row, close
- `Escape` — close, return focus to the trigger
- `Tab` — moves between trigger, search, and toolbar controls

## Theming and dark mode

Every surface is styled with wind's semantic Tailwind tokens — `bg-popover`, `bg-surface-raised`, `bg-surface-hover`, `bg-surface-selected`, `text-foreground`, `text-foreground-muted`, `text-foreground-subtle`, `border-border`, `text-error`, `ring-ring`, `text-brand` — so the picker follows the host's theme class (`light` / `dark` / `.future-*`) with no props or variable overrides. Field errors use the `error` token, never `destructive`: the two resolve to different colours in several themes.

Internals are addressable through stable `data-slot` attributes rather than class names: `model-picker`, `model-picker-trigger`, `model-picker-popup`, `model-picker-toolbar`, `model-picker-listbox`, `model-picker-row`, `model-picker-group-header`, `model-picker-group-by`, `model-picker-tag` (which also carries `data-tag-kind`), `model-picker-folder-switcher`, `model-picker-use-custom-model`.

Overlays (the popup, the folder menu, tooltips, the delete confirm) portal to `document.body` by default. Shadow-DOM and webview hosts should mount a `PortalContainerProvider` around their tree — that redirects every overlay at once — or pass `popupContainer` for this picker alone.

## Internationalization

apollo-wind ships no i18n library and no catalogs: strings are the host's to translate. Every user-visible string is declared once in `i18n.ts` as a `PickerMessage` — `{ id, message, values? }` — keyed under the `modelPicker.*` namespace, the same ids the apollo-react picker uses.

By default the picker resolves them with `defaultTranslator`, which renders each descriptor's English `message` and interpolates `{name}`-style placeholders. A host localizes by passing a `translator`:

```tsx
// react-i18next
const { t } = useTranslation('canvas');
const translator = React.useMemo(
  () => ({ _: (m) => t(m.id, { defaultValue: m.message, ...m.values }) }),
  [t]
);

<ModelPicker translator={translator} ... />
```

```tsx
// Lingui — an `I18n` instance already satisfies the contract structurally
const { i18n } = useLingui();
<ModelPicker translator={i18n} ... />
```

Notes:

- **Pass a stable reference** (`useMemo`), or the picker re-derives chips and groups on every render.
- **A missing key must not throw.** Whatever translator you pass should fall back to the descriptor's `message`; the `defaultValue` in the react-i18next example above does exactly that.
- `PickerMessage.message` is optional so the shape stays structurally compatible with Lingui's `MessageDescriptor`; a descriptor without one falls back to its `id`.

## Performance

- The picker uses `useMemo` for the catalog → annotated → filtered chain so re-renders without a `models` change skip the work.
- Option rows are memoized (`React.memo` + stable handlers): moving the keyboard highlight or hovering re-renders only the two rows whose `active` flag changed, not the whole list.
- The `searchable` variant auto-switches to the virtualized renderer above 120 visible options, so large catalogs stay smooth without configuration. Pass `variant="virtualized"` to force it.
- The forwarded `ref` points at the trigger button — call `ref.current?.focus()` after a failed form submit to move the user to the field.
- Pass **stable references** for `filter`, `badgesFor`, `customTagsFor` (wrap in `useCallback`) and for `requestContext` (wrap in `useMemo`). The picker re-derives chips / re-fetches when these change identity.

Everything above `ModelPicker.tsx` in that list is headless and shared with the apollo-react original; `ModelPicker.tsx`, `ModelTagChip.tsx` and `primitives/` are the wind rewrite.

## Differences from the apollo-react picker

The prop surface and behaviour match, with three deliberate exceptions:

1. **`translator` replaces Lingui.** See [Internationalization](#internationalization). The apollo-react exports `loadModelPickerMessages` / `MODEL_PICKER_LOCALES` / `resolveModelPickerLocale` have no equivalent here — there are no bundled catalogs to load.
2. **No `disablePortal`.** Mount a `PortalContainerProvider` instead; it redirects every overlay in the subtree, not just this one.
3. **No `ApModelPicker` alias.** apollo-wind does not use the `Ap` prefix.

`ModelPicker.test.tsx`, `usePlatformAccess.test.tsx` and `primitives/FolderSwitcher.test.tsx` are byte-identical to the apollo-react originals (98 tests), which is what keeps the two implementations honest.

## Storybook

Stories live in `ModelPicker.stories.tsx` under **Components/UiPath/Model Picker**. Run `pnpm storybook` from `packages/apollo-wind` (port 6006). Key stories:

- **Default** — baseline picker
- **Virtualized (500+ models)** — performance variant
- **With per-product filter** — `filter` prop in action
- **With friendly names (Discovery displayName)** — DTO-authored labels, no product wiring
- **With custom badges (escape hatch)** — free-form `customTagsFor` + `customTagVariants`
- **Admin — can manage BYO** — `canManageByo` + `onUseCustomModel`
- **Viewer — read-only BYO** — default, no admin affordances
- **Folder-scoped Custom Models** — built-in folder switcher
- **Recommended from Discovery + cost badges (agents example)** — DTO `isRecommended` + cost chips
- **Routing substitution** — gateway routes traffic; trigger surfaces the redirection
- **Unknown model — graceful fallback** — stored `value` not in catalog
- **Kitchen sink** — every capability turned on at once
- **Dark mode** — the picker re-skinned by a `dark` wrapper alone
