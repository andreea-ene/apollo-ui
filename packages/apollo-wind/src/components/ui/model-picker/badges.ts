/**
 * The Apollo badge pool.
 *
 * Products do not invent their own badge kinds: they stamp badges from
 * this shared pool (via the `badgesFor` prop), and grow the pool here
 * when a new badge is needed. That keeps labels, colors, and semantics
 * consistent across every product surface, and every pool label is
 * localized once, centrally.
 *
 * Adding a badge is a design-system PR: one entry below plus its
 * `msg()` descriptor in `i18n.ts`. The pool starts with the cost tiers
 * (Basic / Standard / Premium).
 *
 * `customTagsFor` remains as an escape hatch for experiments, but the
 * expectation is that anything worth shipping graduates into the pool.
